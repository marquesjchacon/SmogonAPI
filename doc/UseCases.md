## Encyclopedia Website Developer
While there exists an English Pokemon excyclopedia, user C wants to make another Pokemon encyclopedia in his native language, Arabic. It takes a lot of effort to collect Pokemon illustrations manually, but with the help of Smogon API, he is able to write a script to query Pokemon illustrations, base stats and generations they belong to from Smogon API. He can even query Pokemon abilities and moves from Smogon API, and use other translation tools to translate the introductions and descriptions to Arabic.
